#### Q: Are you tired of looking for testing libraries written in C?
#### A: Well, search no more, you just found the one you need! üôÉ


## Download and Install

To download and install the `libkc_testing` library, follow these steps:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/keepcoding-tech/libkc_testing.git
$ cd libkc_testing && make all
```

Yep, this is it! You can start using the library.

## Use the library

Because I believe that documenting a project is at least as important as writing
the project's code, I have created a very comprehensive wiki for this repository,
explaining in detail how to integrate your code with the `libkc_testing` static
library.

So, head over to the [wiki](https://github.com/keepcoding-tech/libkc_testing/wiki)
to learn more!

## Testing

To compile the tests run `make test`. This command will also run all the tests.

If you want to run a single test, after compilation, all of the executables will
be located inside the `build/bin/test` directory. Simply run the executable with
the same name as the test file that you want to run.

e.g. `./build/bin/test/list`
